Data Access History
================

# Introduction

Below is an overview of the full data accessing history over the course
of this project. This overview is automatically generated based on the
automated Git commits that were triggered whenever a new data object was
detected. It also contains information on other milestones, such as the
submission of preregistrations and finalizing specific analyses. For
more information on the data access workflow, see the [README
file](https://github.com/stefanvermeent/abcd_ddm/README.md).

Each top-level bullet provides the following information:

- Timestamp: Information on when the data was accessed, together with a
  description of which data was accessed
- Milestone: Keyword identifying the type of event (e.g., data access or
  preregistration).
- Data MD5 hash: Unique identifier of the data file that was read in. An
  MD5 hash is generated based on the content of an object. It changes as
  soon as anything about the object changes (e.g., when rows get
  filtered or variables get added). Thus, the MD5 hash can be used to
  verify that the accessed data object did not contain any variables or
  rows that could have biased the analyses.
- Link to code snippet: Link to an `.Rmd` file located in the `.gitlog/`
  folder, containing the exact code that was used to read in the data.

# Analysis objects

This folder contains all analysis objects, i.e., the outputs of the various data processing scripts.
Similar to the data, analysis objects containing individual-level data cannot be shared openly on GitHub.
These analysis objects can be created either by using the synthetic data files or by requesting access to the ABCD data (see [how to reproduce this repository](#reproduce)).
